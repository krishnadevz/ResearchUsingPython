**Basics of python**
* : makes a new copy of the object.
```js
>>> 15 /2.5
6.0
>>> _
6.0
>>> _ /3.4
1.7647058823529411
>>> 
```
```js
a =[1,2,4]
a[-1]
print(a[-1]) //returns last element of the array 
```
* Tuples are immutable sequences 
* S= "krish"
* S=[0:3]
* ids = set([1,2,3,4])
* we can add and remove elements in set using .pop() and .add()
* Consider again sets x={1,2,3} and y={2,3,4}. How could you get {1, 4} from x and y using the provided set methods?
* (x| y) - (x & y)
**Dictionaries**
* Python dictionaries and the key-value pairs they contain dictionaries are mutable.
* age["Tim"]=age["Tim"]+1
